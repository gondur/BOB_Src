FILEMAN Directory:	File management
=================

The class FileMan provides a system for managing the multitude of 
small files that we use without costing the earth for file-naming strings.
The basic mechanism is that each of 256 directories can store up to 256 files.
This 2 byte code then forms the unique identifier for the file.
The original plan was to allow all the files in one directory to be concatinated
using the same scheme used for the landscape and radio chatter, but this never happened.
The other important features of the system are that it allows C++ limited scoping
of file access and that it caches the files against them being re-requested.

The class fileman provides the basic low-level file naming and cacheing facilities, and 
FileMan is a wrapper that provides very crude multitask protection.

The FileBlock class is the basic scoping object. 

FILEMAN.CPP is the main module, with a few secondary routines in WINFILE.CPP
