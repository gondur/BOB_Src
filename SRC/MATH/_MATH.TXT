MATH Directory: Low level maths routines
==============

Math.cpp contains the implementation of the Math_Lib class.

The Angle class we use represents 360 degrees in a 16 byte word, 
which therefore automatically wraps to stay in range.

The next version was going to use a long word for local angle variables which 
would not wrap internally, but would be automatically trimmed before division 
operations, and comparrison operations would actually simply test bit 15, 
providing the same functionality, but with processor optimisation.

Some functions have been converted to use floats as these have become faster.
For example, it is fractionally faster to multiply an integer by a float and 
convert back to integer than to do an integer divide. If you continue to use 
the float for a few more calculation steps the saving becomes significant.

We have also recently invested in floating point distance squared comparrisons 
rather than using an approximation for distance to avoid the square root.

Matrix.cpp contains the old matrix code, which is probably unused, now.
