This Dialogue, which summarizes the outcome of the Session’s Missions, is only available during the Debrief.</p>
<p>
There are four buttons at the bottom of the Dialogue:</p>
<p>
<b>Profile</b></p>
<p>
Click on this button to display the Profile of the highlighted mission. During the Debrief, it is not possible to edit the mission and so some buttons are greyed-out. If you want to edit a mission and try it again, then first click on the Redo button and then go to the Next Period. You are now in Mission Planning and the Mission can be edited.</p>
<p>
<b>Debrief</b></p>
<p>
Click on this button to get a detailed Debrief of the <a href="bob0i7a.htm">highlighted mission</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Redo</b></p>
<p>
Click on this button to redo the highlighted mission. On moving to the Next Period, the mission will be left in the Mission Folder. The aircraft required for <i>redo </i>missions are removed from the available pool before the Directives are used to allocate for the next set of missions.</p>
<p>
<b>Next Period</b></p>
<p>
Click on this button to end the Debrief and move to the Next Period or Session.</p>
