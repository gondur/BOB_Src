This Dialogue is launched when a Mission Type on the Directives Dialogue is clicked.</p>
<p>
The Dialogue lists the targets found in order of priority together with a relevant note. </p>
<p>
Missions are not always allocated against the top targets in the list. There may be insufficient aircraft to launch a mission against a top priority target, however there may be enough aircraft for a lesser target.</p>
