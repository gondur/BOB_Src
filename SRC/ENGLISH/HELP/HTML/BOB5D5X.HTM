<h4>Display</h4>
<p>
This Dialogue displays the blue airfields; that is the ones that are controlled by the UN Forces. Your Fighter Squadrons are shown below the airfield at which they are currently located.</p>
<p>
The aircraft icons to the right of each airfield indicate the airfield’s status. The number of icons shows how many squadrons can be accommodated. The colored icons show the slots already in use. A grey icon indicates that the airfield has spare capacity. The prop aircraft icon means that the airfield resources are limited and only prop aircraft can be located there. Prop and jet aircraft can be located at airfields that have jet icons.</p>
<h4>Function</h4>
<p>
This Dialogue can be used to move squadrons from airfield to airfield. A move will take place automatically at the end of the day’s combat flying. To move a squadron, click on the squadron that you want to move and drag the pointer to the new airfield then release the mouse button. The computer will only allow moves to acceptable airfields.  If the pointer is currently over an unacceptable destination then the restricted icon will be displayed.</p>
<p>
It is possible to make the Dialogue bigger by clicking at the bottom of the Dialogue and then dragging downwards. More UN airfields will then become visible.</p>
<p>
When an acceptable move has been registered, information about the move will be printed next to the moved squadron. Note that the squadron does not move until the end of the day.</p>
<p>
Clicking on an airfield will open the <a href="bob9gvm.htm">Dossier</a> for the relevant airfield. Clicking on a squadron will open the <a href="bob96ur.htm">Squadron Dialogue.</a></p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>
Part of the job of the Commander is to place his Fighter Squadrons at the most suitable airfields. It is safer for them to be kept to the south of Korea. However this reduces their loiter time over the target area. </p>
