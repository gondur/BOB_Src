<p>
A profile holds basic information about a mission such as:</p>
<p>
&#09;Default waypoints and route</p>
<p>
&#09;Default type and number of aircraft for the mission</p>
<p>
Profiles, then, are very like templates encountered in word processing packages. </p>
<dl>
<dt>
When a mission is authorized against a target, you will be prompted to select a mission profile that is appropriate. There are three sets of profiles available:</dt>
<dd>
Standard<p>
User: Strike</p>
<p>
User: Patrol</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
You start with a set of <i>Standard Profiles</i> and these provide a basic mission set-up. The Save button on the <a href="bob2ixx.htm">Mission Profile Dialogue</a> allows you to save your own profiles. This is useful when you have perfected an attack against a particular type of target and you want to use it on another target of the same type.</p>
<p>
After a Standard Profile has been loaded in, the computer a.i. will adjust the number of aircraft allocated to the package to correspond to the size of the target and the surrounding defenses. </p>
<p>
After a user-defined profile has been loaded in, the computer a.i. will make only limited adjustments:</p>
<p>
&#09;B26 and B29 requirements are interchangeable.</p>
<p>
&#09;The two F86 squadrons are also interchangeable.</p>
<p>
In addition, for user-defined profiles:</p>
<p>
The computer a.i. never adjusts the number of flights. </p>
<p>
Fighter-Bomber squadrons are not interchangeable.</p>
