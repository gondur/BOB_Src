<dl>
<dt>
This Dialogue displays the controls for the automatic mission builder. When setting up the mission builder, you have to make two major decisions:</dt>
<dd>
The priority that you want to give to each Mission Type.<p>
The maximum resource to allocate to each Mission Type.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Cross Boxes</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
There are three cross-boxes at the top of the Dialogue:</dt>
<dd>
<b>Autodisplay</b><p>
Automatically displays the Dialogue at the beginning of each session.</p>
<p>
<b>Autogenerate</b></p>
<p>
Automatically generates missions at the beginning of each session. If this option is selected, the missions will be generated even if the Dialogue is not displayed.</p>
<p>
<b>Alpha Strikes</b></p>
<p>
If this option is selected, all aircraft are allocated against one target.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Priority List</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
The list below the cross-boxes consists of a set of Mission Types. At the top and bottom of the list there are two special cases:</dt>
<dd>
At the top there is a record of the aircraft already in use. If you have decided to <a href="bob7183.htm">redo</a> any missions that were unsuccessful on previous sessions, then this line will show the aircraft needed.<p>
The bottom line shows the aircraft that you are not planning to use for this session.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Here is a typical entry for a standard Mission Type:</p>
<p>
Category&#09;Strike&#09;&#09;Fighters&#09;Targets&#09;Missions</p>
<p>
Airfields&#09;48&#09;&#09;16&#09;&#09;19&#09;&#09;4</p>
<p>
This line shows that when 48 Strike and 16 Fighter aircraft are allocated against Airfields, the automatic mission builder found 19 possible targets and was able to use the aircraft allocation to set up 4 missions.</p>
<p>
The number and type of aircraft and duties allocated by the automatic mission builder will reflect the status of the target. For instance, sometimes only medium bombers will be appropriate together with Air and AAA Cover, other times a single flight of F51s may be suitable. </p>
<p>
For the sake of the Directives, the two Sabre squadrons are considered to be Fighter aircraft and the rest are put in the Strike Category. You therefore have up to 32 Fighters and 64 Strike aircraft available. </p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>
The Strike and Fighter aircraft combo-boxes can be used to alter the allocations of aircraft. The list is in order of priority with the Mission Types at the top having the top priority. You will find that it is not possible to allocate more than the maximum available aircraft. Whenever you make a change the allocations are rechecked. If you request more aircraft than are available then the Mission Types at the top of the list are given the priority.</p>
<p>
To change the order of priorities, click on a Mission Type and then drag the mouse pointer to the desired new position. On releasing the mouse button, the Mission Type will be placed in the new position.</p>
<p>
Click on a Mission Type to view details about the targets found and missions found. This information can be used to fine-tune the Directives request to maximize the missions launched.</p>
