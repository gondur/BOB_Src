<p>
You are supporting a ground battle that is being fought on the Korean peninsula. As the peninsula runs north-south you will find that the front line generally lies east-west. Although your specific objectives will vary from campaign to campaign, the overall objective is to support the UN ground forces in their effort to move the front line up to the Chinese border.</p>
<p>
It is possible to support the ground forces by flying Close Air Support missions. This may be necessary when UN Forces are in danger of being over-run. However this is not necessarily the best use of your resources. The Communist ground threat depends on getting supplies to the front line. Successful Interdiction missions can therefore delay a Communist advance and even force a retreat.</p>
<p>
For the sake of convenience, three Main Supply Routes (MSR) have been identified. There is one on the West Coast, one in the Central Region and one on the East. Each Communist asset has been allocated to a route so that during briefings you will be able to determine its sphere of influence. Often the sphere of influence is obvious; sometimes though, because of the mountainous landscape, the connection is not immediately apparent. </p>
<p>
It should be noted that the Supply Routes do not operate independently. There are many cross-links that the Communists use to bypass destroyed bridges etc.</p>
