<h2><a name="hidd_missionstructure"></a>Mission Structure</h2>
<p>
Up to 10 completely independent missions can be set up for any particular session. </p>
<p>
Each mission can consist of up to six Waves. A Wave is made up of the Strike or Main Duty Group that can be supported by an Air Cover Group and an AAA Group. Each Wave can have its own ToT (Time over Target).</p>
<p>
This system gives the flexibility to design either many small missions or fewer complex missions. </p>
<p>
Templates or <a href="bob5t9h.htm">profiles</a> can be produced so that you can easily regenerate missions.</p>
<p>
The Mission Structure has been designed to allow you to generate missions that were typical during the conflict. For instance, due to limited fuel capacity, Combat Air Patrol aircraft could only stay on station for about twenty minutes. bob pilots soalized this and so they waited until the Sabres started to leave before mounting an attack. In this situation the Sabres were vulnerable because they did not have the fuel to stay and fight and also get home. To combat this tactic Sabres were organized into Waves so that as one Wave was ready to leave another was arriving.</p>
