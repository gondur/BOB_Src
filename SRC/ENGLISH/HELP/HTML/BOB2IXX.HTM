<p>
The Mission Profile Dialogue is used to display details about the mission highlighted in the Mission Folder. The main target for the mission is shown in the title bar.</p>
<p>
<a href="bob2ztx.htm">A mission can consist of a number of Waves and each Wave can be made of up to three groups of aircraft.</a></p>
<p>
Each Wave of aircraft is allocated a separate line on the Mission Dialogue. Here is a typical entry:</p>
<p>
Wave&#09;&#09;ToT&#09;Main Duty&#09;AAA Cover&#09;Air Cover</p>
<p>
1.Bomb&#09;07:00&#09;B26(2)&#09;&#09;F84(2)&#09;&#09;F86 sq 1(1)</p>
<p>
<b>1.Bomb</b></p>
<p>
The 1 indicates that this is the first Wave of the mission. Bomb means that the Wave’s main duty is to bomb the main target. This is a Strike Wave.</p>
