On clicking on the Frag icon you will move to the Frag Screen. This is where all the missions that you have designed for the session are displayed.</p>
<p>
You will have been allocated one of the aircraft that has been prepared for the missions to be flown. If you don’t see your name printed in white on the lists then click on the <i>Return to Player</i> tickbox. This will display the list that contains your name.</p>
<p>
If you want to fly in a different aircraft, click on the pilot that you want to replace.</p>

When you first see the Frag List, the flights are grouped according to the mission that they are going to fly. By clicking on the squadron button, it is possible to view the flights in squadron groups.</p>
