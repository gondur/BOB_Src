<h2><a name="hidd_waveinsert"></a>Insert a Wave</h2>
<p>
This Dialogue is launched when the <i>Insert Wave</i> button is clicked on the Mission Dialogue.</p>
<p>
You can use this Dialogue to define the main duty of the Wave and the Time over Target (ToT). It is possible to define a Time over Target that would result in the Wave arriving before the main Wave. This could be useful, for instance, if you want to do some flak suppression before your main Wave arrives.</p>
<p>
There are three possible types of main duty that can be allocated to a Wave:</p>
<p>
<b>Bomb </b></p>
<p>
A mission can consist of a number of Strike Waves. Each Wave can be allocated the main target for the mission or secondary targets can be introduced. </p>
<p>
A Crack and Burn mission would consist of two Waves. These missions are useful against substantial warehouses that contain flammable stores. The first Wave would use iron bombs to crack open the store. The second Wave would use napalm to destroy the stores.</p>
<p>
<b>Flak Suppression</b></p>
<p>
When an important target is heavily defended, it is reasonable to send out a Wave that arrives before the main strike force to suppress the flak. </p>
<p>
<b>Bar CAP</b></p>
<p>
When an important target is located within the bob area of influence, it is reasonable to send out a Wave that arrives before the main strike force to set up a Combat Air Patrol which acts as a barrier between the strike force and the bobs.</p>
<p>
When the main duty is Flak Suppression or Air Cover, it is still possible to have AAA Cover and Air Cover Groups in support. However this is unlikely to be an effective use of your resources.</p>
