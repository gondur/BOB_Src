<h2><a name="hidd_dis"></a>Daily Intelligence Summary</h2>
<p>
This is the Intelligence Summary for the day. The list of Intelligence Topics available to you can be filtered using the radio buttons at the top of the Dialogue:</p>
<p>
<b>Target/General</b></p>
<p>
If Target is ticked then only those intelligence topics associated with a particular location or target are listed.</p>
<p>
If General is ticked then all intelligence topics are listed.</p>
<p>
<b>Latest/Priority</b></p>
<p>
If Latest is ticked then only those intelligence topics generated in the last session are listed.</p>
<p>
If Priority is ticked then all priority intelligence topics are listed. The system is only capable of recording a finite set of topics and so old topics are automatically removed.</p>
<p>
