Instructions for Battle of Britain (BoB) text translation
=========================================================

Line numbers are "correct at time of writing these instructions", but
there may be minor changes to the files before you get them... 

We have provided the following files:

BOB.RC	   	- miscellaneous in-game text
SHAPE_GM.TXT	- item names
UIDNAMES.TXT	- item names
UIDDESCS.TXT	- item names
RADMAST.RES	- radio chatter
[actors.TXT	- this file is for reference only. DO NOT TRANSLATE!]

These files are all 8 bit plain text files. 
Please use the 8bit Windows (ANSI) font for the language locale. 
For Oriental versions we will want to use the locale M/S Multibyte character set.

BOB.RC

	Translate everything in quotes 
		after STRINGTABLE 	(line 19953)
		before APSTUDIO_INVOKED (line 22914)
		2112 pieces of text
	
	Most single words have a limited space, but should be able to
	take a couple of extra characters.
	Many pieces of text will be converted into hints if they do not
	fit.
	Lists begin IDS_L_??_. 
	All the entries in the list will have the
	largest width available, allowing a little extra flexibility
	for the shorter entries.

SHAPE_GM.TXT
	Translate everything in quotes 
	These are generic item names. 280 total
	The SHP_A/B/C/D are intentionally repeated and are identical.

UIDNAMES.TXT
UIDDESCS.TXT
	Translate everything in quotes 
	These are specific target names
	Many of the entries in these 2 files are identical, but a few
	are different.

RADMAST.RES
	There are 3 columns: file name, label, and quoted text.
	Translate everything in quotes in the first half of this file.
	The first 2332 lines out of 4885. 2158 phrases.
	The first half of this file is phrases which will be
	concatentated together to make statments.
	The use of leading and trailing spaces and punctuation are 
	important. Please don't change them.
	Some of the phrases are target names repeated from
	UIDNAMES.TXT. You can copy them, but please insert the leading spaces.

For reference in identifying context for the radio chatter we have provided:
1)	The second half of RADMAST.RES lists the sequences used to 
	concatenate the phrases.
	This consists of a list of the labels that are in the middle column
	of the first part of the file.

2)	The file actors.TXT contains many example fully
	complete statements. Some instances of each phrase are
	hilighted with the filenames, but there are other instances as
	well. DO NOT TRANSLATE ACTORS.TXT

3)	If you are confused... phone us.

To use the actors.TXT file to find an example:

Get the file-name part after the underscore "_" 
	- ignore the underscore and the letters before.
Search for this filename in the actors.txt.
The line above this should contain the phrase in square brackets.
