MOVECODE directory:	Movement Routines
==================

This directory contains most automatic point-to-point movement code.

The main functions are AutoFollowWp and AutoFollowWpWing
These functions arwe called once every 4cs for any aircraft not in ACM

Statistically most aircraft spend most of their time performing these simple
take-off, waypoint following, bombing, and landing manoeuvres, 
and very little time in combat.

By minimising the overhead of this code we leave move processor cycles free 
for combat and allow a higher rate of accelerated time.

Even this is not fast enough for the front-end map screen. On there we have 
an even simpler movecode model which is only called once every 20 seconds!
