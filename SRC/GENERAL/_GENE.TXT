GENERAL Directory:	Generally not much here at all!
=================

WinError.CPP provides the basic Error class and all-purpose SayAndQuit procedure.
SayAndQuit() is embedded into the macro EmitSysError and it's variants.

Malloc.CPP	Used to be out memory allocation debug module, but these days the MFC tracing is sufficient.

Static.CPP	Declares some static member variables that don't fit anywhere else.
