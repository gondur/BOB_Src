INPUT Directory:	All input functionality
================

This directory used to contain all the custom joystick and mouse drivers in FC,
but since switching exclusively to DirectX, I have put all the functionality 
directly into Analogue.CPP (class Analogue)

The file KeyStub.CPP is also active, although it is actually compiled as part of _MFC.CPP

The joystick system also makes heavy use of the routines in 
MFC\SCONTROL.CPP (class SController) for attaching the detected 
devices and axes to game inputs.

KEYLIST.CPP compiles to produce all the keyboard and device button assignments
for the game in on of 8 different shift states:

 Normal:	No shift or lock keys pressed
 Shift:		Left or Right shift key pressed
 Ctrl:		Left or Right control keys pressed
 Alt:		Left or Right alt keys pressed
 Menu:		On a menu or map screen or the polygon cockpit
 Text:		Caps lock key toggled
 Shift Text	Left or Right shift key pressed while in Text mode

This is a change from MiG or FC, and unlike these earlier products, the key definitions
for setting these shift and lock keys is also listed in the table!
